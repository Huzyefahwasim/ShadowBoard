# Shadow Board

An experimental AI interface that simulates an executive boardroom. 

The idea is to have three distinct AI agents (CFO, CMO, Policy Director) debate your strategic initiatives in real-time, helping you find blind spots in your decision making.

## Overview

It's built with React, Tailwind, and Framer Motion because I wanted it to feel fast and fluid. The aesthetic is heavily inspired by high-contrast dashboards—lots of matte black and mint green accents.

### Key Features
- **Persona Triad**: The agents don't just agree with you; they have specific "personalities" and evaluation criteria.
- **Bento Grid Layout**: Everything is organized into a modular grid for quick scanning.
- **Dark Mode Native**: Designed specifically for dark mode from the ground up.

## Setup

If you want to run this locally:

1. Clone the repo
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run dev`

You'll need your own API keys for the backend connection (currently pointed to localhost/internal IP in the code).
